# README.md - Video72

15 January 2026

Update 28 Feb 2026:  The YAML (as provided) requires ESPHome 2025.12.  For those that updated their ESPHome, you can use an ADD-ON that provides the legacy version. Then just reinstall.

# Scope

This is video 72 on Home Assistant and LVGL. In this video we setup the RS485 interface on the Waveshare ESP32-P4 Display Panel device to extend the control devices.  We interact with them using ESPHome LVGL graphic objects.  This effort builds on the previous video that describes the Waveshare ESP32-P4-86-Panel-ETH-2RO aka P4 Smart Box. The video explains how to setup ESPHome with the Modbus device and interact with it using LVGL graphic controls.

In this video, 
 - We demonstrate the graphics display with buttons for each Modbus relay.
 - We discuss the Waveshare Modbus capabilities
 - We explain the wiring between the components
 - Walk through the YAML configuration
