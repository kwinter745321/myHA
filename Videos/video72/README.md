# Scope

This is video 72 on Home Assistant and LVGL. In this video we setup the the RS485 interface on the Waveshare ESP32-P4 Display Panel device to extend the control devices.  We interact with them using ESPHome LVGL graphic objects.  This effort builds on the previous video that describes the Waveshare Smart Box. The video explains how to setup ESPHome with the Modbus device and interact with it using LVGL graphic controls. 

In this video, 
 - We demonstrate the graphics display with buttons for each Modbus relay.
 - We discuss the Waveshare Modbus capabilities
 - We explain the wiring between the components
 - Walk through the YAML configuration
