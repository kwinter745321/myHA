# README - Video 67

12 December 2025

# Scope
This is video 67 on embedded solutions.  In this video, we create a simple LVGL screen with a slider and buttons, and then show how we improved it using images and LVGL styling.  For this effort, our test rig is an ESP32-S3 N16R8 USB board wired to an ILI9341 (240x320) integrated display and touchscreen. 

In this video, 
 - Discuss the ESPHome 2025.11.0 Release.
 - Demonstrate our simple and revised screens on separate ESPHome devices.
 - Discuss our approach and Test Rig wiring.
 - Walk through the YAML configuration.
 - TIP: Verifying our MCU capabilities using the esptool flash-id diagnostic.
