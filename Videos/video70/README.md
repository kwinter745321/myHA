06 January 2026


# Scope
This is video 70 on Home Assistant and LVGL. In this video we setup the two Relays found on the Waveshare ESP32-P4 Display Panel device and interact with them using LVGL graphic objects.  This video builds on the fantastic ESP32-P4 DSI Display configuration pioneered by a group of Home Assistant community members; in particular Alexey Titov. The video explains how to setup the display for the Waveshare Panel's integrated Relays. The next video will discuss the RS485 interface.

In this video, 
 - We demonstrate the graphics display with buttons for each relay.
 - We discuss the Waveshare board capabilities
 - Walk through the YAML configuration
