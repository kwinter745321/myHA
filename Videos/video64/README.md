# Scope

This is video 64 on using the GC9A01 with integrated touchscreen connected to ESP32. In this video, we configure two example displays as a ESPHome device.  For this effort, one device is the popular ESP32-2424S012 Integrated Display and ESP32-C3 device from DIYMalls and the other is the popular Waveshare 1.28 Touch LCD that we connected to an ESP32-S3 chip. 

In this video, 
 - Demonstrate our clock program on the GC9A01 display and its touch capabilities
 - Discuss the two test devices and their setup
 - Walk through the YAML configuration
