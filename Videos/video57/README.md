# Scope

This is video 57 on looking at low cost ESP32 Web Cams. In this video, we compare capabilities of three web cams after learning how to configure them as a ESPHome device.  For this effort, one device is the popular ESP32-Cam and two Web Cams are based on the larger ESP32-S3 chip. 

In this video, 
 - Demonstrate the Home Assistant screens
 - Test and compare the camera capabilities
 - Briefly discuss how we were able to configure each ESPHome device
 - Summarize our findings
